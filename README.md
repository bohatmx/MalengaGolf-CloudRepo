The application serves as the back-end for a suite of Android apps (Administrator, Player and Scorer apps). The application contains the appropriate business logic to run tournaments and manages the MySQL data store.

Golf Groups subscribe to the application and use the suite of Android apps to create and manage their tournaments. The source code for the Android apps is in the repo named **mgAndroidRepo**

This is a Java EE web application developed in Netbeans IDE.
